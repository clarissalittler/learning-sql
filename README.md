# learning-sql

Here we'll going to collect links to various tutorials on learning SQL that I found good reads. I want to focus more on the general principles of relational databases and how to use query languages rather than on the specifics of a particular rdbms.

## Topics

A decent starting point for relational databases is the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). There's a few topics to cover in this document(s) (not so much things I'm going to write but topics I want to make sure that all the links cover)

  1. what's the point of relational databases? (we can presume that the need for databases is already obvious at this point)
     * probably don't bother with explaining why relational dbs vs. nosql approaches 
  2. the theory behind relational databases, i.e. [relational algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra)
     * a review of sets and their operations
     * a review of boolean algebras
  3. normalization of databases
     * review the various normal forms
     * explain why anyone *should care*
         * this has been a problem I've personally had in the past
     * explain when you should optimize and when you shouldn't
  4. sql and what its operators are, probably covered largely in the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language) on SQL
     * probably include exercises if at all possible
     * possibly include descriptions of *typed* operators just to include a bit more CS theory
